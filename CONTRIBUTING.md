📚 Documentation Standards

Code Documentation

typescript
/
 * Sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks
 * @param input - Raw user input string
 * @param maxLength - Maximum allowed length (default: 1000)
 * @returns Sanitized string safe for display
 * @security This function prevents XSS by encoding HTML entities
 * @example
 * typescript
 * const safe = sanitizeInput('<script>alert("xss")</script>');
 * // Returns: '&lt;script&gt;alert("xss")&lt;/script&gt;'
 * 
 */
export const sanitizeInput = (input: string, maxLength = 1000): string => {
  // Implementation
};
